#Figure 1. Inner Electronics and magnet of the Anemometer.
Figure 1 shows the electronics inside the anemometer which consists of a reed switch. A small magnet is attached to the rotator which closes the switch after every rotation by 180 degrees. Using C++ program WindSpiMain.cpp we can count the number times the switch is closed in a given time period.
